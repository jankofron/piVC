#The ENVIRONMENT file defines configuration information that a class instructor
#may want to set before distributing piVC to students.
#
#It follows the same format as all piVC configuration files. Each line is of
#the form key=value.
#
#The instructor can uncomment and change any of the following configuration settings.
#
#The instructor will presumably want to jar the client with the changed ENVIRONMENT
#file and then distribute this jar to students in his class. If you downloaded the full
#piVC source distribution, jaring is easy: you just type
#make in the client directory. A jar will be placed into in the bin directory.
#
#Note that if any of these configuration settings are used, it will not be possible to
#change them without modifying this ENVIORNMENT file. For example, if the server address
#is set in this file, there will be no way to change the server address without editing
#this file.
#
#Note: it is not necessary to use this file. The configuration parameters in this file
#serve as overrides. If this file is not used, the parameters can be set
#using the piVC GUI.

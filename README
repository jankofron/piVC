README for the complete piVC distribution (piVC main server, decision procedure server and client)

About this Distribution
-----------------------
This distribution provides everything needed to use piVC. There are 3 components to the piVC system.
1. Client: This is a light-weight Java application that allows users to edit files and send them to the main server for compilation. Note that the client does not do any compilation itself.
2. Main server: This server compiles the programs, produces the verification conditions (VCs), and queries the DP server to determine whether the VCs are valid. It then returns this information to the client.
3. DP server: This server receives VCs from the main server, applies a decision procedure to determine their validity, and returns this information to the main server. The DP server is a stand-alone binary so that it may be replaced with other, potentially proprietary decision procedures.

Note that for most users, the distinction between the main server and DP server is not relevant. There is a binary "both_servers" that runs both.

Intended Use of This Distribution
---------------------------------
The vast majority of piVC users should only need to download the client JAR file. The first time that a user compiles a program, he/she will be prompted to enter in a server address.

A class instructor should setup a piVC server. He should give this server address and port to his/her students.

Depending on demand and logistics, there may be free piVC servers available for public use. Check out the piVC website for more information on this.

Requirements
------------
Server: *nix system (Linux, Unix, Mac, Cygwin, etc) with OCaml version 3.09 or above.
Client: Sun Java 5.0 or above with support for a GUI.

Installation Instructions
-------------------------
1. "make" from the src directory
2. Do one of the following.
   2a. Download the Yices binary from http://yices.csl.sri.com/. Put the binary into the "bin" directory of this piVC distribution.
or
   2b. If you already have Yices on your computer, edit the "yices_path" variable of conf/pivc-dp-server.conf to point to the location of yices. 

Configuration Instructions
--------------------------
In general, the only configuration that is required is to set the clients to use the correct server address and port. This section provides more detailed configuration information.

There are two configuration files in the conf directory. pivc-server.conf contains configuration settings for the main server, and pivc-dp-server.conf contains configuration settings for the DP server.

The default ports are 4242 for the main server and 4243 for the DP server. If you want to change these defaults, edit the files conf/pivc-server.conf and conf/pivc-dp-server.conf. If you change the DP server's port, be sure to update both the "dp_server_address" variable in conf/pivc-server.conf AND the "port" variable in conf/pivc-dp-server.conf.

If you want to run the DP server on a separate machine to the main server, then change the "dp_server_address" variable in conf/pivc-server.conf.

Running Instructions
--------------------
Servers (main server and DP server combined): Run the binary "both_servers" (in the bin directory). If desired, you can also run the main server and DP server separately using the binaries "main_server" and "dp_server".
Client: Launch PiGui.jar (in the bin directory). This is a standard Java JAR file. On some operating systems, double-clicking will run the program. If this does not work, the program can be launched by entering the command java -jar PiGui.jar into a terminal.

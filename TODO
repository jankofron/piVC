TODOs
-----

Jason
	Classes
	defines and typedefs (see Aaron's first email 1/23/08)
	
	Arrays DP: check remaining TODOs, don't run arrays DP on VCs not in the fragment, fix index set construction
	Bug: Fix syntax errors that are permitted due to temp_expr stuff but are not caught
	Bug: Lots of consecutive array updates kills vc generation, but old PiVC handles them just fine (see samples/array_updates.pi).
	Bug: Fix _v0 highlighting (i.e. _v0 node in basic path has weird highlighting)
	Email stuff.
	Fix xml-lite problems. xml-lite appears to remove sucessive \n's, and also to remove spaces at the beginning of a newline. weird.
	Log server error messages.  Also add command line option to change its directory.
	Server on startup should ensure yices, included.pi, etc. are there and fail if not.
	Put filename into xml and ocaml data structures.
	Bug: Remove stupid a,b counterexample nodes (look for filename field in the location)
	Allow termination arguments after annotation, not just before.
        Bug: function locations not always correct
        Change function locations to prototype only
        Update README. Especially with information about email functionality.  Also talk about coloring of things in VC pane and the inductive core.
        Actions menu for compile/submission
        Space between compile and submit icons
        Bug: submit program dialog box doesn't center correctly
        Report bug feature
        Figure out why we crash on compiling an empty file.
        Fix locations of nonnegative atoms (discuss with Joel)        
	Bug: we get a syntax error if the last line is a C++-style comment (see samples/bad_end_comment.pi or samples/compiler_test_files/bad_return.pi).
	Add names for nonnegative nodes.

Joel
	Static analysis API
	
	Samples directory clean-up, generate official samples files that correspond to all of Aaron's previous ones.
	Termination: check, perhaps make more efficient (cache is_recursive and get_loops?, make get_fn_calls use Set and not be N^2).
	Make sure we use multiple cores for yices stuff (test it and change to fork for dp_server if necessary).
	Timeouts.


Unassigned
	Putting a function call inside a termination annotation (that is in a path) crashes.  Should we just disallow it semantically like we do calls in normal annotations?
	i and l are not distinguishable in the VC pane (when bolded and red, I think) and l and 1 are not distinguishable in the code pane.
	Investigate mysterious undo/redo code pane crash of doom.

--------------------
Possible later TODOs
--------------------

Auto-indent in GUI (especially for assertions).
Better syntax highlighting?
Add support for warnings?  Asserts in Pi?
Running code/debugging.

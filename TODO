Things to add to the lexer and parser
 Parser: global typedefs (structs: see book chapter 5), global defines
	Should typedefs be like VarDecls or should they only be globals?
	Can you typedef things other than structs?
	Should we use defines?  Are they even in the book?
 Lexer: Maybe: T (true), And (&&), etc?


Cascading errors e.g. in arithmetic


Long Term
- "definitions" file (see Aaron's email 12/6/07)
- Hashtables, sets, multisets (see Aaron's email 12/6/07)

Maybe, maybe not
- Put comments in the ast so we can print them out in to-C++ printing.

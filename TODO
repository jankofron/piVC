TODOs
-----

Jason
	Classes
	defines and typedefs (see Aaron's first email 1/23/08)
	
	Arrays DP: check remaining TODOs, don't run arrays DP on VCs not in the fragment, fix index set construction
	Bug: Fix syntax errors that are permitted due to temp_expr stuff but are not caught
	Bug: Lots of consecutive array updates kills vc generation, but old PiVC handles them just fine (see samples/array_updates.pi).
	Bug: Fix _v0 highlighting (i.e. _v0 node in basic path has weird highlighting)
	Email stuff.
	Fix xml-lite problems. xml-lite appears to remove sucessive \n's, and also to remove spaces at the beginning of a newline. weird.
	Refactor xml, ocaml/java data structures from basic path/vc to verification_atom.
	Log server error messages.  Also add command line option to change its directory.
	Server on startup should ensure yices, included.pi, etc. are there and fail if not.
	Put filename into xml and ocaml data structures.
	Bug: Remove stupid a,b counterexample nodes (look for filename field in the location)
	Allow termination arguments after annotation, not just before.


Joel
	Proof of termination (see Aaron's original PiVC email)
		Remaining: check proving that you have termination args everywhere you need them, ensure that all ranking annotations are of the same size (in semantic checking or in vc generation?), only check paths that we need (e.g. not fn -> fn when the callee is not recursive, combine with ensuring same size), perhaps make more efficient (cache is_recursive and get_loops).
		Verdict: make both (first two) compile errors
	Static analysis API
	
	Path names generation (L1 -> assume this -> assume that -> L2)
	GUI tree usability improvements.
	Timeouts.
	Make sure we use multiple cores for yices stuff (test it and change to fork for dp_server if necessary).
	Deal with floats/doubles.  Also, Div and IDiv right now are equivalent.
	Samples directory clean-up, generate official samples files that correspond to all of Aaron's previous ones.

Unassigned
	Figure out why we crash on compiling an empty file.

Possible later TODOs
--------------------

Auto-indent in GUI (especially for assertions).
Better syntax highlighting?
Add support for warnings?  Asserts in Pi?
Running code/debugging.

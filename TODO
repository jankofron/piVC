Things to add to the lexer and parser
 Parser: global typedefs (structs: see book chapter 5), global defines
	Should typedefs be like VarDecls or should they only be globals?
	Can you typedef things other than structs?
	Should we use defines?  Are they even in the book?
 Lexer: Maybe: T (true), And (&&), etc?

Fix the conflict in the parser
Do assertions
fix /* */ comments
Floats/decimals don't work
Get locations working for syntax errors
Cascading errors e.g. in arithmetic
Put comments in the ast so we can print them out in to-C++ printing.

Long Term
- "definitions" file (see Aaron's email 12/6/07)
- Hashtables, sets, multisets (see Aaron's email 12/6/07)

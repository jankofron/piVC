-Things to add to the lexer and parser

Parser: assertions (functions, for loops, while loops, as stmts, and the rules for them), global typedefs (structs: see book chapter 5), global defines, length expr (|a| in book)
Lexer: T (true), := vs =, <->, ->, forall, exists, div (p 116)

- Fix the conflict in the parser=======
 Parser: global typedefs (structs: see book chapter 5), global defines
 Lexer: Maybe: T (true), And (&&), etc?

Floats/decimals don't work
Get locations working for syntax errors
Cascading errors e.g. in arithmetic
Put comments in the ast so we can print them out in to-C++ printing.



Long Term
- "definitions" file (see Aaron's email 12/6/07)
- Hashtables, sets, multisets (see Aaron's email 12/6/07)

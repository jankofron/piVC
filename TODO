TODOs
-----

Jason
	Classes
	defines and typedefs (see Aaron's first email 1/23/08)
	Arrays DP long term work

	Bug: Lots of consecutive array updates kills vc generation, but old PiVC handles them just fine (see samples/array_updates.pi).
	Server on startup should ensure yices, included.pi, etc. are there and fail if not.
	Put filename into xml and ocaml data structures.
	Bug: Remove stupid a,b counterexample nodes (look for filename field in the location)
        Update README. Especially with information about email functionality.  Also talk about coloring of things in VC pane and the inductive core.


Joel
	Static analysis API
	
	Termination: check, perhaps make more efficient (cache is_recursive and get_loops?, make get_fn_calls use Set and not be N^2).
	Make sure we use multiple cores for yices stuff (test it and change to fork for dp_server if necessary).
	Timeouts.

Unassigned
	Profile our server code, see where it slows down, and fix it.
	i and l are not distinguishable in the VC pane (when bolded and red, I think) and l and 1 are not distinguishable in the code pane.  Also, the yellow text in the VC pane is almost impossible to read (see UnsortedUnion.pi).
	Investigate mysterious undo/redo code pane crash of doom.
	Should we support things like (l <= i <= u) as a convenience?
	Document the built-in predicates somewhere, probably the README.
	Remove built-in support for the length() function.
	Add support for int e := ? syntax (see SortedUnion, UnsortedUnion).

--------------------
Possible later TODOs
--------------------

Auto-indent in GUI (especially for assertions).  And maybe emacs-style tab support.
Better syntax highlighting?
Add support for warnings (:= vs =, postcondition that uses a parameter and not comparing it to rv (e.g. sorted(a, 0, |a|)))?  Asserts in Pi?
Running code/debugging.
Add an analysis that will propgate VCs?  Or maybe make it a heuristic?

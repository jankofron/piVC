Things to add to the lexer and parser
 Parser: global typedefs (structs: see book chapter 5), global defines
	Should typedefs be like VarDecls or should they only be globals?
	Can you typedef things other than structs?
	Can you make a struct without a typedef?
	Should we use defines?  Are they even in the book?
 Lexer: Maybe: T (true), And (&&), etc?

DP stuff
Break stmt
	Add a struct or pass around recursively?
	Maybe also make location an option?
Semantically check assertions
Figure out how to deal with predicates (forall, sorted, etc.).
rv: handle in semantic check assertions
defines
Caching VCs

Long Term
- "definitions" file (see Aaron's email 12/6/07)
- Hashtables, sets, multisets (see Aaron's email 12/6/07)

Maybe, maybe not
- Put comments in the ast so we can print them out in to-C++ printing.
- ocamlmake

Short-term TODOs
----------------

Jason
        don't restrict array reads to identifiers
	change all refs from node to step
	config files (ports to bind to, IP/ports to connect to, saved files dir)
Joel
	Typedef stuff like path (in bp, vc, etc) to make types more readable
        Bug: filename outdated in client title bar after save as operation
        Don't lock up entire GUI while client is awaiting response from server

-----------------------------
Proposed High-level timetable
-----------------------------

Week 1-2
	Joel: Counter-example generation (see two of Aaron's emails 1/27/2008)

Week 3
	Jason: Figure out how to deal with predicates (sorted, partitioned, etc.)(and user-defined definitions file).
	Both: Equivalent in functionality to Aaron's version, with no remaining bugs

Week 4
	Joel: VC caching
	Jason: Break stmt, semantically check assertions

Week 5
	Jason: defines, structs and typedefs (see Aaron's first email 1/23/08)
	Joel: Proof of termination (see Aaron's original PiVC email)

Week 6
	At least one of hashtables, sets, multisets (see Aaron's email 12/6/07)
	Have the gui send its code to the server in xml and have the server parse that xml.

Week 7
	Joel: Static analysis API
	Jason: Run "Aaron's algorithm" of static analysis (see Aaron's email 1/27/08)

Week 8
	Both: Fully-working version, only polishing is necessary

Week 9
	Convert to C++ and run.
	Finished, ready-to-go

Week 10
	Party time!

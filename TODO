	GUI: highlighting and linking
Joel

Things to add to the lexer and parser
 Parser: global typedefs (structs: see book chapter 5), global defines
	Should typedefs be like VarDecls or should they only be globals?
	Can you typedef things other than structs?
	Can you make a struct without a typedef?
	Should we use defines?  Are they even in the book?
 Lexer: Maybe: T (true), And (&&), etc?

DP stuff
Break stmt
	Add a struct or pass around recursively?
	Maybe also make location an option?
Semantically check assertions
Figure out how to deal with predicates (forall, sorted, etc.).
rv: handle in semantic check assertions
defines
Should we error when function that should return doesn't?
Caching VCs
	Do we even need user ids?
GUI
	Which icons should we use?
	Should functions store location as their declaration so the GUI can link to them?

Long Term
- "definitions" file (see Aaron's email 12/6/07)
- Hashtables, sets, multisets (see Aaron's email 12/6/07)

Maybe, maybe not
- Put comments in the ast so we can print them out in to-C++ printing.
- ocamlmake

Questions for Aaron
  Struct stuff?
  DP
  Non assign stmts in basic paths?

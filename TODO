	change all refs to node to step
	Fix basic path bugs
	Forall, exists, and variables defined in them
	DP setup: Give VarDecls gids, Identifiers VarDecl ref
Joel
	DP stuff (see Aaron's second email 1/23/08): new context, declare (renamed) variables, push assertion, getsat, delete context

Figure out how to deal with predicates (sorted, partitioned, etc.).
Break stmt
	Add a struct or pass around recursively?
	Maybe also make location an option?
Semantically check assertions

defines
Caching VCs
Structs and typedefs (see Aaron's first email 1/23/08)
Have the gui send its code to the server in xml and have the server parse that xml.

Long Term
- "definitions" file (see Aaron's email 12/6/07)
- Hashtables, sets, multisets (see Aaron's email 12/6/07)
- User-defined predicates.
- Run "Aaron's algorithm" of static analysis (see Aaron's email 1/27/08)
- Visualize counterexamples (see two of Aaron's emails 1/27/2008)
- Termination arguments (see Aaron's original PiVC email)

Less important
- Typedef stuff like path (in bp, vc, etc) to make types more readable

Maybe, maybe not
- Put comments in the ast so we can print them out in to-C++ printing.
- ocamlmake
